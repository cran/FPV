Description: The main goal of this package is drawing the membership function of the fuzzy p-value which is defined as a fuzzy set on the unit interval for three following problems: (1) testing crisp hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Filzmoser and Viertl (2004) <doi:10.1007/s001840300269>, (2) testing fuzzy hypotheses based on crisp data, see Parchami et al. (2010) <doi:10.1007/s00362-008-0133-4>, and (3) testing fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Parchami et al. (2012) <doi:10.1007/s00362-010-0353-2>. In all cases, the fuzziness of data or / and the fuzziness of the boundary of null fuzzy hypothesis transported via the p-value function and causes to produce the fuzzy p-value. If the p-value is fuzzy, it is more appropriate to consider a fuzzy significance level for the problem. Therefore, the comparison of the fuzzy p-value and the fuzzy significance level is evaluated by a fuzzy ranking method in this package.
